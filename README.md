# Cafe Shares

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

set up and run the development server:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Next.js App: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Storybook: [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:8000/api/*](http://localhost:8000/api/*). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/*.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
